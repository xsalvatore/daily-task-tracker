**Daily Task Tracker**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

As a way to get more familiar with the MERN stack and the back-end, I created a classic to-do application with a MongoDB backend and an Express Server. 

**Tech used :**
- React for the front-end
- Node and Express for the back-en
- Axios to make request to MongoDB and the Express server

**Installation guide :**
- Download or clone the repo to your computer
- Open the terminal and access the location where the repo has been downloaded/cloned
- Run npm install to download the different modules for the back-end
- Go back once and access the client folder
- Run npm install to download the different modules for the front-end
- Go back once to return to the root
- Run the npm run dev script to run the front and back-end at once using concurrently

*I have included the API keys for testing purposes and might be removed at any time.*
